Some things still need work:

- We need a min-cost max-flow implementation (Ford-Fulkerson with min-cost augmenting path ok?)
- A push-relabel max-flow implementation would probably be a good idea
- Ford-Fulkerson might be useful too
- k-D tree implementation? (maybe just for k=3 or so)
- The geometry library needs tests
- WindingNumber in Polygon.cc probably needs to relax its comparisons to "within EPS"
- The following files have yet to be reviewed:
	- LinearAlgebra.cc
	- MaximumFlowDinic.cc
	- Simplex.cc
- SuffixArray.cc: Add in functionality for "find length of common prefix of adjacent suffixes"
