Some things still need work:

- Ford-Fulkerson might be useful too
- k-D tree implementation? (maybe just for k=3 or so)
- The geometry library needs tests
	- A couple people have gone over it with a critical eye, so this is low priority
- The following files have yet to be reviewed:
	- MaximumFlowDinic.cc
	- Simplex.cc
	- FFT.cc
- LinearAlgebra.cc needs tests.
- Consider adding code to LinearAlgebra.cc for computing rank from RREF.
- Comments could be condensed and simplified throughout.
- Some of the algorithms need more exposition--let's use the whitespace we
	have!
- Replace enscript by LaTeX
- There should be a reference implementation of rational numbers.
- FOR(v,l,u) is in the .cc.compiled files sometimes; remove it.
