Some things still need work:

- Ford-Fulkerson might be useful
- The geometry library needs tests
	- A couple people have gone over it with a critical eye, so this is low priority
- The following files have yet to be reviewed:
	- Simplex.cc
	- FFT.cc
- LinearAlgebra.cc needs tests.
- MaximumFlow-Dinic.cc needs tests.
- Consider adding code to LinearAlgebra.cc for computing rank from RREF.
- Comments could be condensed and simplified throughout.
- There should be a reference implementation of rational numbers.
- #define FOR(v,l,u) is in the .cc.compiled files sometimes; remove it.
