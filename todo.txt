Some things still need work:

- Ford-Fulkerson might be useful too
- k-D tree implementation? (maybe just for k=3 or so)
- The geometry library needs tests
	- A couple people have gone over it with a critical eye, so this is low priority
- The following files have yet to be reviewed:
	- MaximumFlowDinic.cc
	- Simplex.cc
	- FFT.cc
- The code for solving many simultaneous linear equations is just wrong.
- Comments could be condensed and simplified throughout.
- Some of the algorithms need more exposition--let's use the whitespace we
	have!
- Bellman-Ford uses an adjacency matrix and thus isn't any better than
	Floyd-Warshall.
- The font used in the .ps file has 1s and ls ambiguous.
- The function names in FloatCompare.cc are too long.
	- Use, eg. ``feq'' or ``flt'' or whatever
- The syntax coloring sucks in the ps file.
- There should be a reference implementation of rational numbers.
- FOR(v,l,u) is in the .cc.compiled files sometimes; remove it.
- The logic in the Floyd-Warshall implementation could be simplified.
